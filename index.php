              <p style="font-size: 20px;color:black;font-weight: 160;font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;">The first railway on Indian sub-continent ran over a stretch of 21 miles from Bombay to Thane. The idea of a railway to connect Bombay with Thane, Kalyan and with the Thal and Bhore Ghats inclines first occurred to Mr. George Clark, the Chief Engineer of the Bombay Government, during a visit to Bhandup in 1843.

The formal inauguration ceremony was performed on 16th April 1853, when 14 railway carriages carrying about 400 guests left Bori Bunder at 3.30 pm "amidst the loud applause of a vast multitude and to the salute of 21 guns." The first passenger train steamed out of Howrah station destined for Hooghly, a distance of 24 miles, on 15th August, 1854. Thus the first section of the East Indian Railway was opened to public traffic, inaugurating the beginning of railway transport on the Eastern side of the subcontinent.</p>

                  <p>The route network of Indian Railways has expanded very slowly in the past. In 1947, Indian Railways
inherited 53,996 of route kms of rail network and today we stand at 64,099 kms -
 We have to
While doubling of lines, gauge conversions, electrification and many
other positive things did happen during the last six decades, the overall expansion of the Indian Railways
to areas it did not serve earlier has been unacceptably slow.The Indian Railways has been playing this role in the past, but not
fully.. Our Vision is to deepen and broaden this agenda of inclusive and integrative growth and to take it to new
heights.</p>

                    <p>Railways face stiff competition from road transport in both freight and passenger businesses and from aviation
sector in respect of the premium-class passenger business segment. Given the massive scale of expansion of
the National Highway network, build-up of huge capacity in the highly competitive trucking industry and entry of
modern multi-axle commercial vehicles, competition from road carriers will intensify. However, Railways score
over other competing modes by virtue of the minimal impact on environment and efficiency of land use. Given the
density of population in our country and the pace of urbanization, road networks will face severe congestion. While expanding the network, the Railways will examine and adopt innovative land-saving solutions like
building infrastructure.</p>

                    <p>In the coming decade, Indian Railways must catch up with the developed railways of the world in the matter of speed of trains. The current effort to provide fast non-stop train services under the new brand of Duronto will
continue. In addition, the vision aims at raising the speed of regular passenger trains to 160-200 kmph on segregated routes, which will bring about a major transformation in train travel.
The Vision 2020 also envisages the implementation of at least 4 high speed rail projects to provide bullet train services at 250-350 kmph.This programme would specifically aim at improving the connectivity to our far-flung areas such as
Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, and all the States in the North-East, namely,
Arunachal Pradesh, Assam.</p>
